# quack-core/src/quack-core/paths/__init__.py
"""
Path resolution and management utilities for quack_core.

This package provides utilities for resolving paths, detecting project structure,
and inferring context from file locations in QuackCore projects.
"""

"""
NOTE: This module intentionally does NOT expose low-level path functions.
Use `quack-core.fs` for join_path, split_path, etc. to avoid API duplication.
