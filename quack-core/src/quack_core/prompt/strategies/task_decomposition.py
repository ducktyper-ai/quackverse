I need to solve this complex task: {task_description}

To solve this effectively, please:

1. Break down this task into smaller, manageable subtasks
2. List each subtask in the order they should be addressed
3. Solve each subtask step by step
4. For each subtask, explain your approach and reasoning
5. Combine the results of all subtasks to solve the original problem
