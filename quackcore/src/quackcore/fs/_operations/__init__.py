# quackcore/src/quackcore/fs/_operations/__init__.py
"""
Core filesystem _operations implementation.

This module provides the implementation of filesystem _operations
with proper error handling and consistent return values. It assembles
all the operation mixins into the FileSystemOperations class,
which is the primary internal implementation used by the public API.

The _operations package follows this contract:
- Internal methods return basic types (str, bytes, Path, bool)
- Input types are limited to str or Path and resolved early
- Exceptions are raised naturally and not caught at this level
