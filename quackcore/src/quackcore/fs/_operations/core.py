"""
Core path resolution and utility functionality for filesystem _operations.

This module provides internal helper functions for path resolution and
initialization tasks. These functions are used by the FileSystemOperations
class and its mixins but are not meant to be consumed directly by external code.

    Resolve a path relative to the base directory.

    This function takes a path (string or Path object) and resolves it relative
    to the provided base directory. If the path is absolute, it's returned as-is.
    Otherwise, it's joined with the base directory.

    Args:

        It's used by the _resolve_path method in FileSystemOperations.
