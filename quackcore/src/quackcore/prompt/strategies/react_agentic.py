To solve this problem, think through this step-by-step:

1. First, understand what is being asked
2. Form a plan using the available tools
3. For each step in your plan:
   - Think: What do you know and what do you need to find out?
   - Act: Select and use the appropriate tool
   - Observe: Note the result
   - Decide: Determine the next step based on your observation

{examples_section}For each step, use the following format:

Thought: <your reasoning about what to do next>
Action: <tool_name>(<parameters>)
Observation: <result of the action>
...
Thought: I now know the answer
Final Answer: <your final answer to the task>

Begin!
