## Overview

The Google Mail integration module is a key component of QuackCore that allows QuackTools (plugins in the QuackVerse ecosystem) to perform operations such as:

- **Authentication:** Establishing a secure connection with Gmail through OAuth 2.0.
- **Email Operations:** Listing emails based on a query, downloading email messages (and their attachments), and processing email content.
- **Error Management:** Consistent error handling with clear logging and retry mechanisms.

The module is organized into multiple sub-components such as service management, configuration, API protocols, utility functions, and operations for specific tasks (e.g., handling attachments).

---

## Architecture Overview

The module is split into several key files and packages:

- **`service.py`:**  
  Contains the `GoogleMailService` class responsible for overall integration logic. It loads configurations, manages authentication, and offers methods like `list_emails()` and `download_email()`.

- **`config.py`:**  
  Uses Pydantic models (specifically the `GmailServiceConfig`) to define and validate configuration settings. This ensures you have the required parameters, such as `storage_path` and `oauth_scope`, correctly set.

- **`protocols.py`:**  
  Defines protocols (interfaces) such as `GmailService`, `GoogleCredentials`, `GmailRequest`, and others. These help enforce type safety and ensure consistent implementation across the module.

- **`operations/`:**  
  Contains submodules that implement Gmail operations:
  - **`auth.py`:** Handles authentication and initializes the Gmail API service using the Google API client.
  - **`email.py`:** Implements functions for listing and downloading emails. It also includes helper functions to extract email headers, decode content, and process attachments.
  - **`attachments.py`:** Provides functionality for handling attachments, including filename cleaning, file path resolution, and binary file writing.

- **`utils/api.py`:**  
  Provides utility functions such as `execute_api_request` and a decorator `with_exponential_backoff` to perform API calls with retry logic and error handling.

Each of these components collaborates to provide a consistent interface for interacting with Gmail through your QuackTool.

## Authentication and Credentials

Authentication is central to the module. Here’s how it works:

1. **OAuth2 Client Secrets and Credentials Files:**  
   - You must have a **client secrets file** (JSON) obtained from the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - The **credentials file** stores the OAuth tokens (access token, refresh token, token URI, client ID, and client secret).

2. **GoogleAuthProvider:**  
   - In `service.py`, the `GoogleMailService.initialize()` method instantiates a `GoogleAuthProvider` using the paths to your client secrets and credentials files.
   - This provider calls `get_credentials()` to retrieve the current tokens. If the access token has expired, it will use the refresh token to obtain a new one.

3. **Initializing the Gmail API Service:**  
   - Using the credentials, the module calls `auth.initialize_gmail_service()`, which internally uses the `googleapiclient.discovery.build` function. This creates the `GmailService` object that you use to perform subsequent API operations.
   - **Tip for Junior Developers:** If you’re new to OAuth2, make sure you follow the [Google OAuth2 guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) to correctly set up your project and understand the scopes you need (by default, this module uses `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`).

---

## Configuration Options

The library supports flexible configuration. Whether you supply parameters directly or load them from a file, here is what you need to know:

- **`client_secrets_file` (str):**  
  Path to your client secrets JSON file.

- **`credentials_file` (str):**  
  Path to the file storing your OAuth2 tokens.

- **`storage_path` (str):**  
  Directory where downloaded emails and attachments are stored.  
  > **Note:** If not provided explicitly, the configuration loaded by `GoogleMailService` must include this parameter.

- **`oauth_scope` (list[str]):**  
  Specifies the Gmail API scopes. The default is `["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"]`.

- **`max_retries` (int), `initial_delay` (float), `max_delay` (float):**  
  Used for configuring exponential backoff when the Gmail API returns errors. These settings help in handling rate-limiting or transient API issues.

- **`include_subject` and `include_sender` (bool):**  
  Flags to indicate whether the email subject and sender information should be included in the downloaded HTML file.

The configuration is validated using a Pydantic model in `config.py` (specifically, `GmailServiceConfig`), ensuring that each field is present and properly typed.

## Usage Examples

Below are detailed code snippets to help you quickly start using the Google Mail integration.

### Initializing the Service

Create an integration instance either via the factory method or by directly instantiating the service:

```python
from quack_core.integrations.google.mail import create_integration

# Option 1: Using the factory function (default configuration)
google_mail_service = create_integration()

# Option 2: Custom configuration by specifying necessary parameters
google_mail_service = google_mail_service.__class__(
    client_secrets_file="/path/to/client_secrets.json",
    credentials_file="/path/to/credentials.json",
    storage_path="/path/to/storage/directory",
    oauth_scope=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"],
    include_subject=True,
    include_sender=True,
    max_retries=5,
    initial_delay=1.0,
    max_delay=30.0,
    log_level=20,  # logging.INFO level
)

# Initialize the service
init_result = google_mail_service.initialize()
if not init_result.success:
    print("Initialization failed:", init_result.message)
    exit(1)
print(init_result.message)
```

### Listing Emails

To list emails based on a search query (or the default query built from configuration):

```python
# Example: Listing emails that might be from a specific sender
search_query = "from:example@example.com"
list_result = google_mail_service.list_emails(query=search_query)

if list_result.success:
    emails = list_result.content
    print("Found {} emails:".format(len(emails)))
    for email_summary in emails:
        print(email_summary)
else:
    print("Error listing emails:", list_result.message)
```

### Downloading an Email

Download a specific email by its Gmail message ID. This example also shows how the email's subject and sender can be included in the final HTML file.

```python
# Replace with a valid Gmail message ID from your listed emails
msg_id = "YOUR_MESSAGE_ID_HERE"
download_result = google_mail_service.download_email(msg_id)

if download_result.success:
    print("Email downloaded successfully to:", download_result.content)
else:
    print("Error downloading email:", download_result.message)
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Error Handling Mechanism

- **IntegrationResult:**  
  Most operations return an `IntegrationResult` object that contains:
  - `success`: Boolean flag indicating if the operation succeeded.
  - `content`: The successful output (e.g., a list of emails or file path).
  - `message`: Additional information, especially on failure.

- **Logging:**  
  The module makes use of the Python `logging` module. Adjusting `log_level` helps to see more granular information during development or debugging.

- **API Retry Logic:**  
  - API calls (e.g., listing messages, fetching message details, or downloading attachments) use functions from `utils/api.py` to implement exponential backoff.
  - In case of HTTP errors (like rate limits or transient server issues), the library automatically retries the call up to `max_retries`.

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Issues:**  
   - **Symptom:** The service fails during initialization with an error about credentials.
   - **Solution:**  
     - Double-check that `client_secrets_file` and `credentials_file` paths are correct.
     - Confirm that your Google project is properly set up and that the OAuth2 client configuration includes the proper redirect URIs.
     - Review the [Google OAuth2 documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) for setup guidance.

2. **File System Errors:**  
   - **Symptom:** Errors during email download or attachment saving (e.g., "Failed to create directory").
   - **Solution:**  
     - Verify that the `storage_path` exists or that your application has permission to create directories and write files.
     - Check the filesystem logs for more detailed errors and adjust folder permissions if necessary.

3. **API Rate Limits and Quota:**  
   - **Symptom:** API calls fail with errors like 429 (Too Many Requests).
   - **Solution:**  
     - Adjust the `max_retries`, `initial_delay`, and `max_delay` parameters to better handle transient errors.
     - Monitor your API quota in the Google Cloud Console.

4. **Attachment Processing Errors:**  
   - **Symptom:** Errors during decoding or saving of attachments.
   - **Solution:**  
     - Ensure that the attachments are properly base64-encoded.
     - Review error logs for decoding errors and verify that your storage path has sufficient space and correct permissions.

## Advanced Topics

### Exponential Backoff
The utility function `with_exponential_backoff` wraps API calls to automatically retry failed requests under specific HTTP error conditions (e.g., 429, 500, 503). If you need to adjust or extend this functionality, review the implementation in `utils/api.py`.

### Customizing Logging
The module uses the standard Python logging module. You can set the logging level via the `log_level` parameter when initializing the `GoogleMailService` to see more detailed debug information during development.

### Extending the Integration
While the current module supports essential operations, you can extend it by:
- Adding new methods for different Gmail API endpoints.
- Implementing custom handlers for non-standard email formats.
- Creating subclasses of `GoogleMailService` to encapsulate additional business logic needed in your QuackTools.
