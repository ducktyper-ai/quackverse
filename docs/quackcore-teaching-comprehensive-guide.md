- **NPC**: Interactive teaching assistant capabilities
- **GitHub**: Integration with GitHub for assignments and grading
- **Academy**: Traditional learning management system features

You can use these components separately or together, depending on your needs.

## Core Components

### XP System

The XP (Experience Points) system is the foundation of the gamification features. Users earn XP for completing tasks, which contributes to their level and progression.

#### Key Concepts

- **XP Events**: Discrete activities or accomplishments that award XP
- **Levels**: Calculated based on accumulated XP (1 level per 100 XP by default)
- **Level-up Events**: Special events triggered when users reach new levels

#### XP Event Example

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import XPEvent

# Create an XP event
code_review_event = XPEvent(
    id="code-review-123",
    label="Completed Code Review",
    points=25,
    metadata={"repo": "quackverse/quackcore", "pr_number": 42}
)
```

### Badge System

Badges are achievements that users can earn by reaching certain milestones, completing specific quests, or through other activities.

#### Key Concepts

- **Badge Types**: XP-based, quest-based, and special badges
- **Badge Requirements**: Conditions for earning badges (XP thresholds, quest completion)
- **Badge Display**: Badges have emoji representations for visual appeal

#### Badge Example

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import Badge

# Define a badge
contributor_badge = Badge(
    id="first-contribution",
    name="First Contribution",
    description="Made your first contribution to the project",
    required_xp=0,  # Not XP-based
    emoji="🏆"
)
```

### Quest System

Quests are specific challenges that users can complete to earn XP and badges. They provide structure and goals for the educational journey.

#### Key Concepts

- **Quest Types**: GitHub-based, tool usage, and tutorial quests
- **Quest Verification**: Functions that check if a quest has been completed
- **Quest Rewards**: XP and optional badges awarded for completion

#### Quest Example

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import Quest

# Define a quest
github_quest = Quest(
    id="star-repository",
    name="Star Repository",
    description="Star the main repository on GitHub",
    reward_xp=50,
    badge_id="github-collaborator",
    github_check={"repo": "quackverse/quackcore", "action": "star"},
)
```

### User Progress

The user progress system tracks a user's XP, completed events, quests, and earned badges across sessions.

#### Key Concepts

- **Progress Storage**: Data stored locally in the user's home directory
- **Progress Tracking**: Methods to check completion status and XP accumulation
- **GitHub Integration**: Linking progress to GitHub usernames for verification

#### User Progress Example

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import utils

# Load user progress
user_progress = utils.load_progress()

# Check user stats
current_level = user_progress.get_level()
total_xp = user_progress.xp
next_level_xp = user_progress.get_xp_to_next_level()
```

### Certificates

The certificate system allows you to create verifiable proof of course completion or achievement.

#### Key Concepts

- **Course Completion**: Certificates are awarded for completing courses
- **Digital Verification**: Signatures ensure certificate authenticity
- **Shareable Format**: Certificates can be exported to shareable strings

#### Certificate Example

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import certificates, utils

# Load user progress
user = utils.load_progress()

# Create a certificate if eligible
if certificates.has_earned_certificate(user, "python-basics"):
    cert = certificates.create_certificate(
        user,
        course_id="python-basics",
        additional_data={"course_name": "Python Programming Basics"}
    )
    
    # Format as markdown for display
    markdown = certificates.format_certificate_markdown(cert)
    
    # Export to shareable string
    shareable = certificates.certificate_to_string(cert)
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

The QuackCore teaching module is part of the larger QuackCore package. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install quackcore
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of using the teaching module to track user progress:

```python
from quackcore.teaching import xp, utils
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import XPEvent

# Load user progress
user = utils.load_progress()

# Add XP for completing a task
event = XPEvent(id="used-tutorial", label="Completed Tutorial", points=10)
xp.add_xp(user, event)

# Check for new level
current_level = user.get_level()
xp_to_next = user.get_xp_to_next_level()
print(f"You are now level {current_level}! Need {xp_to_next} XP for next level.")

# Save updated progress
utils.save_progress(user)
```

### Example Workflows

#### Tracking Tutorial Completion

```python
from quackcore.teaching import xp, quests, utils
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import XPEvent

def mark_tutorial_complete(tutorial_id, tutorial_name):
    # Load user progress
    user = utils.load_progress()
    
    # Create XP event
    event = XPEvent(
        id=f"tutorial-{tutorial_id}",
        label=f"Completed Tutorial: {tutorial_name}",
        points=25
    )
    
    # Add XP
    added, old_level = xp.add_xp(user, event)
    
    # Check if tutorial completion triggers a quest
    if tutorial_id == "quickstart":
        quests.complete_quest(user, "complete-tutorial")
    
    # Save progress
    utils.save_progress(user)
    
    # Return level info
    new_level = user.get_level()
    return {
        "xp_added": 25 if added else 0,
        "level_up": new_level > old_level,
        "current_level": new_level,
        "xp_to_next": user.get_xp_to_next_level()
    }
```

#### Creating a GitHub-Connected Learning Path

```python
from quackcore.teaching import badges, quests, utils
from quackcore.teaching.core.gamification_service import GamificationService

def setup_github_learning_path(repo_name):
    # Initialize gamification service
    gamifier = GamificationService()
    
    # Create a workflow for GitHub interaction
    results = []
    
    # Step 1: Star repository
    star_result = gamifier.handle_github_star(repo_name)
    results.append(star_result)
    
    # Step 2: Automatically check for opened PR
    # (This would normally be triggered by GitHub webhook)
    # For demo, we'll simulate the user has opened a PR
    pr_result = gamifier.handle_github_pr_submission(1, repo_name)
    results.append(pr_result)
    
    # Step 3: Simulate PR merged
    merge_result = gamifier.handle_github_pr_merged(1, repo_name)
    results.append(merge_result)
    
    # Load badges earned
    user = utils.load_progress()
    earned_badges = badges.get_user_badges(user)
    
    return {
        "completed_steps": len(results),
        "total_xp_gained": sum(r.xp_added for r in results),
        "earned_badges": [b.name for b in earned_badges],
        "current_level": user.get_level()
    }
```

## Core Module Deep Dive

### Working with User Progress

The User Progress system is the central component that tracks all user achievements and metrics.

#### Loading and Saving Progress

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import utils

# Load existing progress or create new if none exists
user = utils.load_progress()

# Make changes to user progress
user.xp += 10
user.completed_event_ids.append("new-event-id")

# Save changes
utils.save_progress(user)
```

#### Custom GitHub Username

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import utils

# Set a custom GitHub username
user = utils.load_progress()
user.github_username = "octocat"
utils.save_progress(user)

# Later, use this username for GitHub verification
```

#### Backup and Reset

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import utils

# Backup current progress
utils.backup_progress("before_big_change")

# Reset progress (e.g., for testing)
utils.reset_progress()

# Create new progress with default values
new_user = utils.create_new_progress()
```

### Managing XP

The XP system handles experience points, which contribute to user levels and progression.

#### Adding XP

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import xp, utils
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import XPEvent

# Load user
user = utils.load_progress()

# Define XP event
event = XPEvent(
    id="solved-challenge",
    label="Solved Programming Challenge",
    points=15,
    metadata={"challenge_id": "fibonacci", "difficulty": "medium"}
)

# Add XP and check if this is new
is_new, old_level = xp.add_xp(user, event)

if is_new:
    print(f"Earned {event.points} XP from {event.label}!")
else:
    print("Already completed this event.")

# Check for level up
new_level = user.get_level()
if new_level > old_level:
    print(f"Leveled up to level {new_level}!")

# Save changes
utils.save_progress(user)
```

#### Quest-Based XP

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import xp, utils

# Add XP from a completed quest
user = utils.load_progress()
xp.add_xp_from_quest(user, "github-first-pr", 100)
utils.save_progress(user)
```

#### Calculating XP Requirements

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import utils

user = utils.load_progress()

# Get current level
level = user.get_level()

# Calculate XP needed for next level
xp_needed = user.get_xp_to_next_level()

# Display progress
total_xp = user.xp
next_level = level + 1
percentage = ((level * 100) - (xp_needed)) / (level * 100) * 100

print(f"Level {level} ({total_xp} XP)")
print(f"Progress to Level {next_level}: {percentage:.1f}%")
print(f"{xp_needed} XP needed")
```

### Working with Badges

Badges are achievements that users can earn to showcase their progress and skills.

#### Defining Badges

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import Badge
from quackcore.teaching.core import badges

# Define a custom badge
custom_badge = Badge(
    id="code-ninja", 
    name="Code Ninja", 
    description="Mastered advanced coding techniques",
    required_xp=1000,  # XP-based badge
    emoji="🥷"
)

# Access pre-defined badges
all_badges = badges.get_all_badges()
github_badge = badges.get_badge("github-collaborator")
```

#### Awarding Badges

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import badges, utils

# Load user progress
user = utils.load_progress()

# Award a badge
if badges.award_badge(user, "code-ninja"):
    print("Awarded Code Ninja badge!")
else:
    print("Badge already earned or not found.")

# Save progress
utils.save_progress(user)
```

#### Checking Badge Progress

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import badges, utils

user = utils.load_progress()

# Check progress toward a badge
progress = badges.get_badge_progress(user, "duck-expert")
percentage = progress * 100

print(f"Progress toward Duck Expert badge: {percentage:.1f}%")

# Get next badges user could earn
next_badges = badges.get_next_badges(user, limit=3)
for badge in next_badges:
    print(f"{badge.emoji} {badge.name}: {badge.required_xp} XP required")
```

### Working with Quests

Quests are challenges that users can complete to earn XP and badges.

#### Accessing Quests

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import quests, utils

# Get all available quests
all_quests = quests.get_all_quests()

# Get a specific quest
star_quest = quests.get_quest("star-quackcore")

# Get quests for a specific user
user = utils.load_progress()
user_quests = quests.get_user_quests(user)
completed = user_quests["completed"]
available = user_quests["available"]
```

#### Checking Quest Completion

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import quests, utils

user = utils.load_progress()

# Check if specific quest is completed
if user.has_completed_quest("star-quackcore"):
    print("Repository already starred!")
else:
    print("Star the repository to complete this quest.")

# Check for newly completed quests
newly_completed = quests.check_quest_completion(user)
if newly_completed:
    print(f"You've completed {len(newly_completed)} new quests!")
    for quest in newly_completed:
        print(f"- {quest.name} (+{quest.reward_xp} XP)")
```

#### Completing Quests Manually

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import quests, utils

user = utils.load_progress()

# Complete a quest (e.g., after external verification)
if quests.complete_quest(user, "run-ducktyper", forced=True):
    print("Quest marked as complete!")
else:
    print("Quest already completed or not found.")

# Save progress
utils.save_progress(user)
```

#### Getting Quest Suggestions

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import quests, utils

user = utils.load_progress()

# Get suggested quests for the user
suggested = quests.get_suggested_quests(user, limit=3)
print("Suggested quests:")
for quest in suggested:
    print(f"- {quest.name}: {quest.description} (+{quest.reward_xp} XP)")
```

### Working with Certificates

Certificates provide formal recognition for course completion or achievements.

#### Creating Certificates

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import certificates, utils

user = utils.load_progress()

# Check if user is eligible for a certificate
if certificates.has_earned_certificate(user, "quackverse-basics"):
    # Create the certificate
    cert = certificates.create_certificate(
        user,
        course_id="quackverse-basics",
        issuer="QuackVerse Academy",
        additional_data={"course_name": "QuackVerse Basics", "instructor": "Dr. Duck"}
    )
    
    # Generate markdown representation
    markdown = certificates.format_certificate_markdown(cert)
    print(markdown)
    
    # Export for sharing
    shareable = certificates.certificate_to_string(cert)
    print(f"Share this certificate: {shareable}")
else:
    print("Complete all required quests to earn this certificate.")
```

#### Verifying Certificates

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core import certificates

# Parse a certificate from a shared string
cert_string = "eyJpZCI6I..."  # Received certificate string
try:
    cert = certificates.string_to_certificate(cert_string)
    
    # Verify authenticity
    if certificates.verify_certificate(cert):
        print(f"Valid certificate for {cert['course_id']} issued to {cert['recipient']}")
    else:
        print("Invalid certificate! Verification failed.")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid certificate format.")
```

## Teaching NPC (Quackster)

### Introduction to Quackster

Quackster is an interactive teaching assistant (NPC) that helps guide users through the learning process. It can answer questions, suggest quests, verify completion, and provide tutorials.

#### Key Features

- Interactive conversational interface
- Access to user progress and achievements
- Ability to verify quest completion
- Access to tutorials and guidance
- Customizable personality and responses

### Integrating Quackster in Your Applications

#### Basic Integration

```python
from quackcore.teaching.npc import run_npc_session
from quackcore.teaching.npc.schema import TeachingNPCInput

def handle_user_query(user_text, github_username=None):
    # Create input for Quackster
    npc_input = TeachingNPCInput(
        user_input=user_text,
        github_username=github_username
    )
    
    # Run the NPC session
    response = run_npc_session(npc_input)
    
    return {
        "response": response.response_text,
        "actions": response.actions_taken,
        "suggested_quests": response.suggested_quests,
        "verify_quests": response.should_verify_quests
    }

# Example usage
result = handle_user_query("What quests can I do next?")
print(result["response"])
```

#### Maintaining Conversation Context

```python
from quackcore.teaching.npc import run_npc_session
from quackcore.teaching.npc.schema import TeachingNPCInput

class QuacksterChat:
    def __init__(self, github_username=None):
        self.github_username = github_username
        self.conversation_history = []
        
    def chat(self, user_message):
        # Create input with conversation history
        npc_input = TeachingNPCInput(
            user_input=user_message,
            github_username=self.github_username,
            conversation_context=self.conversation_history
        )
        
        # Get response
        response = run_npc_session(npc_input)
        
        # Update conversation history
        self.conversation_history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_message})
        self.conversation_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.response_text})
        
        # Trim history if too long
        if len(self.conversation_history) > 10:
            self.conversation_history = self.conversation_history[-10:]
            
        return response

# Example usage
chatbot = QuacksterChat(github_username="octocat")
response1 = chatbot.chat("What's my current level?")
print(response1.response_text)

response2 = chatbot.chat("What should I do next?")
print(response2.response_text)
```

### Customizing Quackster

#### Custom NPC Profile

```python
import os
from quackcore.teaching.npc.schema import QuacksterProfile

# Set environment variables for customization
os.environ["QUACK_NPC_TONE"] = "enthusiastic"

# Or create a YAML file with custom profile
"""
# quackster_profile.yaml
name: "Professor Quack"
tone: "academic"
backstory: "A distinguished professor of Computer Science who enjoys teaching through practical examples"
expertise: 
  - "Python"
  - "Algorithms"
  - "Data Structures"
  - "Best Practices"
teaching_style: "Socratic method with humor"
emoji_style: "sparse"
catchphrases:
  - "Knowledge is power!"
  - "Let's code and learn!"
  - "Questions lead to understanding."
  - "Practice makes perfect!"
"""

# Then set the environment variable to point to this file
os.environ["QUACK_NPC_PROFILE"] = "~/quackster_profile.yaml"
```

#### Custom Tutorials and Content

```python
import os

# Set a custom path for tutorials
os.environ["QUACK_TUTORIAL_PATH"] = "~/my_project/tutorials"

# Create Markdown files in this directory:
"""
# python_basics.md
## Variables and Types

Python variables are created when you assign a value to them:

```python
x = 5
name = "Quackster"
```

## Control Flow

Use if statements to make decisions:

```python
if x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
```
"""

# Now Quackster can access these tutorials when asked
```

        return None
```

### LMS/Academy Features

The academy module provides traditional Learning Management System (LMS) features for course management, assignments, and grading.

#### Setting Up a Course

```python
from quackcore.teaching.academy import service
from quackcore.teaching.academy import Course, CourseModule, ModuleItem, ItemType

# Initialize the teaching service
service.initialize()

# Create a new course context
result = service.create_context(
    course_name="Python Programming 101",
    github_org="my-org"
)

if result.success:
    # Create a course with modules
    course = Course.create(
        name="Python Programming 101",
        code="PY101",
        description="Introduction to Python programming",
        instructors=["dr_duck"]
    )
    
    # Add modules
    intro_module = CourseModule.create(
        title="Introduction to Python",
        description="Basic Python concepts and setup",
        position=0
    )
    
    # Add items to module
    intro_module.add_item(
        ModuleItem.create(
            title="Installing Python",
            type=ItemType.LECTURE,
            description="Learn how to install Python on your system"
        )
    )
    
    intro_module.add_item(
        ModuleItem.create(
            title="First Python Program",
            type=ItemType.ASSIGNMENT,
            description="Write your first Python program",
            points=10.0
        )
    )
    
    # Add module to course
    course.add_module(intro_module)
    
    # Save the course configuration
    # (In a real implementation, you would save this to a file or database)
```

#### Managing Assignments

```python
from quackcore.teaching.academy import service
from quackcore.teaching.academy import Assignment, AssignmentType, AssignmentStatus

# Create an assignment
assignment = Assignment.create(
    name="Data Structure Implementation",
    description="Implement a linked list in Python",
    assignment_type=AssignmentType.INDIVIDUAL,
    points=100.0
)

# Publish the assignment
assignment.publish()

# Create repositories for students from a template
result = service.create_assignment_from_template(
    assignment_name="data-structures",
    template_repo="python-class/linked-list-template",
    description="Implement a linked list in Python",
    due_date="2023-12-01T23:59:59",
    students=["student1", "student2", "student3"]
)

if result.success:
    print(f"Created {len(result.repositories)} assignment repositories")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result.error}")
```

#### Grading Student Work

```python
from quackcore.teaching.academy.grading import GradingCriteria, GradingCriterion, GradeResult

# Define grading criteria
criteria = GradingCriteria.create(
    name="Linked List Implementation",
    assignment_id="linked-list",
    passing_threshold=0.7
)

# Add specific criteria
criteria.add_criterion(
    GradingCriterion.create(
        name="Implementation",
        points=50.0,
        description="Correct implementation of linked list operations",
        required=True
    )
)

criteria.add_criterion(
    GradingCriterion.create(
        name="Testing",
        points=25.0,
        description="Comprehensive test cases"
    )
)

criteria.add_criterion(
    GradingCriterion.create(
        name="Documentation",
        points=25.0,
        description="Clear and complete documentation"
    )
)

# Create a grade result
grade = GradeResult.create(
    submission_id="student1-linked-list",
    student_id="student1",
    assignment_id="linked-list",
    score=85.0,
    max_points=100.0,
    passed=True,
    criterion_scores={
        "Implementation": 40.0,
        "Testing": 20.0,
        "Documentation": 25.0
    },
    comments="Good work overall. Implementation could be more efficient."
)

# Format for feedback
feedback_text = grade.format_for_feedback()

# Update gamification based on grade
grade.update_gamification()
```

### Gamification Service

The Gamification Service integrates all teaching components to provide a unified system for tracking progress and awarding achievements.

#### Basic Usage

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core.gamification_service import GamificationService

# Create service instance (loads user progress automatically)
service = GamificationService()

# Handle an XP event
event_result = service.handle_event(
    XPEvent(
        id="code-review-complete",
        label="Completed Code Review",
        points=25
    )
)

print(event_result.message)  # Displays achievement message

# The service automatically:
# - Adds XP from the event
# - Checks for level ups
# - Checks for newly completed quests
# - Checks for newly earned badges
```

#### Handling Multiple Events

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core.gamification_service import GamificationService
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import XPEvent

def track_project_completion(user_project):
    # Create service
    gamifier = GamificationService()
    
    # Create multiple XP events
    events = [
        XPEvent(
            id=f"project-planning-{user_project.id}",
            label="Completed Project Planning",
            points=10,
            metadata={"project_id": user_project.id, "phase": "planning"}
        ),
        XPEvent(
            id=f"project-implementation-{user_project.id}",
            label="Completed Implementation",
            points=30,
            metadata={"project_id": user_project.id, "phase": "implementation"}
        ),
        XPEvent(
            id=f"project-testing-{user_project.id}",
            label="Completed Testing",
            points=20,
            metadata={"project_id": user_project.id, "phase": "testing"}
        )
    ]
    
    # Handle all events together
    result = gamifier.handle_events(events)
    
    return {
        "xp_gained": result.xp_added,
        "level_up": result.level_up,
        "new_level": result.level,
        "completed_quests": result.completed_quests,
        "earned_badges": result.earned_badges,
        "message": result.message
    }
```

#### Handling GitHub Interactions

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core.gamification_service import GamificationService

def handle_github_workflow(repo, pr_number, action):
    # Create service
    gamifier = GamificationService()
    
    if action == "star":
        # Handle repository star
        result = gamifier.handle_github_star(repo)
    elif action == "submit_pr":
        # Handle PR submission
        result = gamifier.handle_github_pr_submission(pr_number, repo)
    elif action == "merge_pr":
        # Handle PR merge
        result = gamifier.handle_github_pr_merged(pr_number, repo)
    else:
        return {"success": False, "message": "Unknown action"}
    
    return {
        "success": True,
        "xp_gained": result.xp_added,
        "level_up": result.level_up,
        "completed_quests": result.completed_quests,
        "earned_badges": result.earned_badges,
        "message": result.message
    }
```

#### Course and Learning Integrations

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core.gamification_service import GamificationService

def track_learning_progress(course_id, module_id=None, assignment_id=None):
    # Create service
    gamifier = GamificationService()
    
    if module_id:
        # Record module completion
        result = gamifier.handle_module_completion(
            course_id=course_id,
            module_id=module_id,
            module_name=f"Module {module_id}"
        )
    elif assignment_id:
        # Record assignment completion (with score)
        result = gamifier.handle_assignment_completion(
            assignment_id=assignment_id,
            assignment_name=f"Assignment {assignment_id}",
            score=90.0,
            max_score=100.0
        )
    else:
        # Record full course completion
        result = gamifier.handle_course_completion(
            course_id=course_id,
            course_name=f"Course {course_id}"
        )
    
    return {
        "xp_gained": result.xp_added,
        "level_up": result.level_up,
        "new_level": result.level,
        "completed_quests": result.completed_quests,
        "earned_badges": result.earned_badges,
        "message": result.message
    }
```

## Best Practices

### Recommended Patterns

#### Event-Based Tracking

Track user actions as discrete events with unique IDs to avoid duplicate XP awards:

```python
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import XPEvent

# Generate a unique event ID based on user and action
def create_unique_event(user_id, action, item_id=None):
    if item_id:
        event_id = f"{action}-{item_id}-{user_id}"
    else:
        event_id = f"{action}-{user_id}"
        
    return XPEvent(
        id=event_id,
        label=f"User {user_id} performed {action}",
        points=get_points_for_action(action),
        metadata={"user_id": user_id, "action": action, "item_id": item_id}
    )
```

#### Progress Display Helpers

Create consistent display methods for progress information:

```python
def format_progress_bar(current, maximum, length=20):
    """Create a text-based progress bar."""
    filled = int(length * (current / maximum))
    bar = '█' * filled + '░' * (length - filled)
    percentage = current / maximum * 100
    return f"[{bar}] {percentage:.1f}%"

def format_user_progress(user):
    """Format user's progress information."""
    level = user.get_level()
    xp = user.xp
    next_level = level + 1
    xp_required = next_level * 100
    xp_have = xp - ((level - 1) * 100)
    xp_needed = xp_required - xp_have
    
    return {
        "level": level,
        "xp": xp,
        "xp_needed": xp_needed,
        "progress_bar": format_progress_bar(xp_have, 100),
        "badge_count": len(user.earned_badge_ids),
        "quest_count": len(user.completed_quest_ids),
        "displayable": f"Level {level} ({xp} XP)\n{format_progress_bar(xp_have, 100)}\n{xp_needed} XP needed for Level {next_level}"
    }
```

#### Consistent Notification System

Create a uniform way to communicate achievements to users:

```python
class AchievementNotifier:
    """Handle achievement notifications consistently."""
    
    def __init__(self, notify_func=print):
        self.notify_func = notify_func
        
    def notify_xp(self, event, is_new):
        """Notify about XP earned."""
        if is_new:
            self.notify_func(f"🎯 Earned {event.points} XP from {event.label}")
            
    def notify_level_up(self, old_level, new_level):
        """Notify about level up."""
        self.notify_func(f"🎆 Level Up! You advanced from level {old_level} to level {new_level}!")
        
    def notify_badge(self, badge):
        """Notify about badge earned."""
        self.notify_func(f"🏆 Badge Unlocked: {badge.emoji} {badge.name} - {badge.description}")
        
    def notify_quest(self, quest):
        """Notify about quest completed."""
        self.notify_func(f"✅ Quest Completed: {quest.name} (+{quest.reward_xp} XP)")
        
    def handle_gamification_result(self, result):
        """Process a GamificationResult and generate appropriate notifications."""
        if result.xp_added > 0:
            self.notify_func(f"🎯 Earned {result.xp_added} XP")
            
        if result.level_up:
            self.notify_func(f"🎆 Level Up! You advanced to level {result.level}!")
            
        for quest_id in result.completed_quests:
            quest = quests.get_quest(quest_id)
            if quest:
                self.notify_quest(quest)
                
        for badge_id in result.earned_badges:
            badge = badges.get_badge(badge_id)
            if badge:
                self.notify_badge(badge)
                
        if result.message:
            self.notify_func(result.message)
```

#### Periodic Progress Check

Schedule regular checks for quest completion and updates:

```python
def periodic_progress_check():
    """Perform a periodic check for quest completion and updates."""
    # Load user progress
    user = utils.load_progress()
    
    # Check for completed quests
    newly_completed = quests.check_quest_completion(user)
    
    # Apply completed quests
    for quest in newly_completed:
        quests.complete_quest(user, quest.id)
        print(f"Quest completed: {quest.name}")
    
    # Check for badge eligibility
    user_badges = badges.get_user_badges(user)
    next_badges = badges.get_next_badges(user)
    
    if next_badges:
        closest_badge = next_badges[0]
        progress = badges.get_badge_progress(user, closest_badge.id)
        print(f"Next badge: {closest_badge.name} - {progress*100:.1f}% complete")
    
    # Save updated progress
    utils.save_progress(user)
    
    return {
        "quests_completed": [q.id for q in newly_completed],
        "badge_count": len(user_badges),
        "next_badge_progress": progress if next_badges else 0
    }
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. Direct Manipulation of XP

**Bad Practice**:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS
user = utils.load_progress()
user.xp += 50  # Directly manipulating XP
utils.save_progress(user)
```

**Good Practice**:
```python
# DO THIS INSTEAD
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import XPEvent
from quackcore.teaching.core import xp, utils

user = utils.load_progress()
event = XPEvent(id="unique-event-id", label="Descriptive Label", points=50)
xp.add_xp(user, event)
utils.save_progress(user)
```

#### 2. Ignoring Idempotency

**Bad Practice**:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS
def award_points_for_login():
    user = utils.load_progress()
    # This doesn't check if points were already awarded today
    event = XPEvent(id="daily-login", label="Daily Login", points=5)
    xp.add_xp(user, event)
    utils.save_progress(user)
```

**Good Practice**:
```python
# DO THIS INSTEAD
from datetime import datetime

def award_points_for_login():
    user = utils.load_progress()
    today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    event_id = f"daily-login-{today}"
    
    # Check if already awarded today
    if not user.has_completed_event(event_id):
        event = XPEvent(id=event_id, label="Daily Login", points=5)
        xp.add_xp(user, event)
        utils.save_progress(user)
        return True
    return False
```

#### 3. Ignoring GitHub Username

**Bad Practice**:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS
def verify_github_actions():
    user = utils.load_progress()
    # This doesn't check if GitHub username is set
    quests.apply_completed_quests(user)
    utils.save_progress(user)
```

**Good Practice**:
```python
# DO THIS INSTEAD
def verify_github_actions():
    user = utils.load_progress()
    
    if not user.github_username:
        print("GitHub username not set. Please set it to track GitHub quests.")
        return False
        
    quests.apply_completed_quests(user)
    utils.save_progress(user)
    return True
```

#### 4. Not Using the Gamification Service

**Bad Practice**:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS - Manual orchestration is error-prone
def handle_course_completion(user, course_id):
    # Manual XP award
    event = XPEvent(id=f"course-{course_id}", label=f"Completed Course {course_id}", points=100)
    xp.add_xp(user, event)
    
    # Manual badge check
    if not user.has_earned_badge("duck-graduate"):
        badges.award_badge(user, "duck-graduate")
        
    # Save progress
    utils.save_progress(user)
```

**Good Practice**:
```python
# DO THIS INSTEAD - Use the integrated service
from quackcore.teaching.core.gamification_service import GamificationService

def handle_course_completion(course_id, course_name):
    service = GamificationService()
    result = service.handle_course_completion(course_id, course_name)
    
    if result.message:
        print(result.message)
        
    return result
```

#### 5. Loading Progress Multiple Times

**Bad Practice**:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS - Inefficient and can lead to data loss
def update_user_stats(user_id, completed_quest):
    # Load user progress
    user = utils.load_progress()
    
    # Update XP
    event = XPEvent(id=f"quest-{completed_quest}", label=f"Completed Quest", points=50)
    xp.add_xp(user, event)
    utils.save_progress(user)
    
    # Load again in another function (data race potential)
    user = utils.load_progress()
    quests.complete_quest(user, completed_quest)
    utils.save_progress(user)
```

**Good Practice**:
```python
# DO THIS INSTEAD - Load once, make all changes, save once
def update_user_stats(user_id, completed_quest):
    # Load user progress once
    user = utils.load_progress()
    
    # Make all updates
    event = XPEvent(id=f"quest-{completed_quest}", label=f"Completed Quest", points=50)
    xp.add_xp(user, event)
    quests.complete_quest(user, completed_quest)
    
    # Save once at the end
    utils.save_progress(user)
```

## Example Projects

### CLI Tool with Gamification

Here's how you might implement a CLI tool that includes gamification:

```python
import argparse
import sys

from quackcore.teaching import xp, utils, badges, quests
from quackcore.teaching.core.models import XPEvent
from quackcore.teaching.core.gamification_service import GamificationService

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="MyCoolTool - Now with gamification!")
    parser.add_argument("command", choices=["run", "status", "help"])
    parser.add_argument("--args", help="Arguments for the command")
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    if args.command == "help":
        show_help()
        return
        
    elif args.command == "status":
        show_status()
        return
        
    elif args.command == "run":
        run_tool(args.args)
        return
        
def show_help():
    print("MyCoolTool Help")
    print("Commands:")
    print("  run    - Run the main tool")
    print("  status - Show your progress and achievements")
    print("  help   - Show this help message")
    
def show_status():
    # Load user progress
    user = utils.load_progress()
    
    # Calculate status information
    level = user.get_level()
    xp = user.xp
    next_level = level + 1
    xp_needed = user.get_xp_to_next_level()
    
    # Get badges and quests
    user_badges = badges.get_user_badges(user)
    completed_quests = len(user.completed_quest_ids)
    
    # Display status
    print(f"=== MyCoolTool User Status ===")
    print(f"Level: {level} ({xp} XP)")
    print(f"XP needed for next level: {xp_needed}")
    print(f"Badges earned: {len(user_badges)}")
    print(f"Quests completed: {completed_quests}")
    
    if user_badges:
        print("\nYour badges:")
        for badge in user_badges:
            print(f"  {badge.emoji} {badge.name} - {badge.description}")
            
    # Suggest next quests
    suggested = quests.get_suggested_quests(user, limit=3)
    if suggested:
        print("\nSuggested quests:")
        for quest in suggested:
            print(f"  - {quest.name}: {quest.description}")
            
def run_tool(tool_args):
    # Your actual tool functionality here
    print(f"Running tool with args: {tool_args}")
    
    # Then add gamification
    gamifier = GamificationService()
    
    # Track tool usage
    result = gamifier.handle_tool_usage("MyCoolTool", "run")
    
    # Check for quest completion
    quests_completed = result.completed_quests
    if quests_completed:
        print("\n🎉 Quest Completed! 🎉")
        for quest_id in quests_completed:
            quest = quests.get_quest(quest_id)
            if quest:
                print(f"✅ {quest.name}: +{quest.reward_xp} XP")
    
    # Display badges earned            
    badges_earned = result.earned_badges
    if badges_earned:
        print("\n🏆 Badge Earned! 🏆")
        for badge_id in badges_earned:
            badge = badges.get_badge(badge_id)
            if badge:
                print(f"{badge.emoji} {badge.name} - {badge.description}")
    
    # Show level up
    if result.level_up:
        print(f"\n🎆 LEVEL UP! 🎆")
        print(f"You are now level {result.level}!")
        
    # Get status after changes
    user = utils.load_progress()

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. XP Not Being Awarded

**Issue**: You've created an XP event, but the user's XP isn't increasing.

**Solution**:
- Check if the event ID is unique. The system prevents duplicate XP awards for the same event ID.
- Verify that `utils.save_progress(user)` is called after adding XP.
- Check that the event ID isn't already in the user's `completed_event_ids` list.

```python
# Check if event already completed
if not user.has_completed_event("event-id"):
    # It's a new event, add XP
    event = XPEvent(id="event-id", label="Event Label", points=10)
    xp.add_xp(user, event)
    utils.save_progress(user)
else:
    print("Event already completed")
```

#### 2. GitHub Verification Not Working

**Issue**: GitHub-based quests aren't being properly verified.

**Solution**:
- Ensure the user has a GitHub username set: `user.github_username`
- Check the GitHub integration is properly initialized
- Verify the quest has the correct `github_check` parameters
- Try manually completing the quest to see if it works

```python
# Debug GitHub verification issues
from quackcore.teaching.core import github_api

# Check if GitHub integration is working
if not github_api._get_github_client():
    print("GitHub client not available")
    
# Test GitHub operations directly
user = utils.load_progress()
if user.github_username:
    has_starred = github_api.has_starred_repo(user.github_username, "quackverse/quackcore")
    print(f"Has starred repository: {has_starred}")
    
    has_pr = github_api.has_opened_pr(user.github_username, "quackverse")
    print(f"Has opened PR: {has_pr}")
else:
    print("GitHub username not set")
```

#### 3. Quests Not Completing Automatically

**Issue**: You've completed quest requirements, but quests aren't being marked as complete.

**Solution**:
- Ensure you're calling `quests.apply_completed_quests(user)` to check and apply new completions
- Verify the quest has a proper `verify_func` implementation
- Check that quest requirements are properly met
- Try manually completing the quest for testing

```python
# Debug quest completion
from quackcore.teaching.core import quests, utils

user = utils.load_progress()

# Get a specific quest
quest = quests.get_quest("quest-id")
if quest and quest.verify_func:
    # Test the verification function directly
    result = quest.verify_func(user)
    print(f"Quest verification result: {result}")
    
    # If verification passes but quest isn't completing,
    # try manual completion
    if result and not user.has_completed_quest(quest.id):
        quests.complete_quest(user, quest.id)
        utils.save_progress(user)
        print("Manually completed quest")
```

#### 4. NPC (Quackster) Not Responding Correctly

**Issue**: The Quackster NPC isn't giving expected responses or is giving errors.

**Solution**:
- Check that the LLM integration is properly configured
- Verify that user memory is being updated
- Try resetting the conversation history
- Check if tools are being executed correctly

```python
from quackcore.teaching.npc import run_npc_session
from quackcore.teaching.npc.schema import TeachingNPCInput
from quackcore.teaching.npc import memory

# Debug NPC responses
def debug_npc_response(user_input):
    # Get user memory
    user_memory = memory.get_user_memory()
    
    # Create minimal input
    npc_input = TeachingNPCInput(
        user_input=user_input,
        github_username=user_memory.github_username,
        conversation_context=[]  # Empty to remove history issues
    )
    
    # Try to get response
    try:
        response = run_npc_session(npc_input)
        print(f"Response: {response.response_text}")
        print(f"Actions: {response.actions_taken}")
        return response
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None
```

#### 5. Progress Not Saving

**Issue**: User progress changes aren't being saved between sessions.

**Solution**:
- Make sure you're calling `utils.save_progress(user)` after making changes
- Check if the user has permissions to write to the save location
- Verify the correct data directory is being used
- Try saving to a custom location for testing

```python
import os
from quackcore.teaching.core import utils

# Debug progress saving
def verify_progress_saving():
    # Get the data directory path
    data_dir = utils.get_user_data_dir()
    print(f"Data directory: {data_dir}")
    
    # Check if directory exists and is writable
    if not os.path.exists(data_dir):
        print(f"Directory doesn't exist. Creating...")
        try:
            os.makedirs(data_dir, exist_ok=True)
            print("Directory created successfully")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error creating directory: {e}")
            return False
    
    # Check write permissions
    if not os.access(data_dir, os.W_OK):
        print("No write permission to data directory")
        return False
        
    # Test saving
    user = utils.load_progress()
    original_xp = user.xp
    
    # Make a change
    user.xp += 1
    
    # Try to save
    if utils.save_progress(user):
        print("Progress saved successfully")
        
        # Reload to verify
        reloaded = utils.load_progress()
        if reloaded.xp == original_xp + 1:
            print("Verified: Changes were saved correctly")
            
            # Restore original value
            reloaded.xp = original_xp
            utils.save_progress(reloaded)
            return True
        else:
            print("Error: Changes were not saved correctly")
            return False
    else:
        print("Error saving progress")
        return False
```
