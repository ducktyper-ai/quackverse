"""
LEGACY API for backward compatibility.

⚠️ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE IN NEW CODE ⚠️

This module exports the v1.x workflow API for tools that haven't
migrated to the new doctrine-compliant pattern yet.

All classes here are LEGACY and maintained only for backward compatibility.
They are NOT doctrine-compliant and should not be used for new tools.

Deprecated: Will be removed in v4.0

For new tools, use:
    from quack_runner.workflow import ToolRunner
    from quack_core.tools import BaseQuackTool

DOCTRINE FENCE (fix #4, #5):
Legacy code in this module may:
- Use global service registries
- Perform I/O from Ring B
- Auto-initialize services
This is acceptable ONLY because it's explicitly quarantined as LEGACY.
The new ToolRunner path never touches this code.

# CRITICAL: NO LEGACY INTEGRATION MIXIN (blocker #2 resolution)
#
# quack_runner/workflow/mixins/integration_enabled.py DOES NOT EXIST.
# It was removed entirely - no warning version, no legacy version.
#
# Why removed completely:
# - Used global service registry (get_integration_service)
# - Did lazy initialization and auto-init
# - Violated doctrine even as "legacy"
# - Too easy to import accidentally
#
# The ONLY integration mixin is quack_core.tools.IntegrationEnabledMixin:
# - Services from ctx.services (runner-provided)
# - No global registry
# - No auto-initialization
# - Type-safe with optional validation
#
# DO NOT re-create a runner version. It will not be accepted.
# Tools must use the doctrine-compliant version in quack_core.tools.
